# Data Science Web App
A Data Science application that allows users to efficiently perform a wide range of common data science tasks without writing code or requiring significant Data Science knowledge.

- Features include the ability to upload and manipulate data in the form of a CSV, label encode variables, create heatmaps of correlations, and generate various types of plots. 
- The tool also enables users to create, train, evaluate, and refine machine learning models such as KNN, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, linear regression, Ridge regression, and Lasso regression. 
- These pre-trained models may be exported from the web application for use in other implementations.
